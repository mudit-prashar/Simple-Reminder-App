# UML diagram for Reminders App

Reminder APP creates an arraylist which consist of all the lists. The mehods are createList, renameList, deleteList and selectList. 
The app is connected to the database where all the reminders information is stored over time. 
The list creates an another array which will consist of all the reminders added to it. 
When the list has been created, in order to add a reminder you would have to select through a list of Reminder types before you actually make a reminder. 
The list is also connected to the automatic save class which allows to save any input or changes made to list or reminders at a set interval.
