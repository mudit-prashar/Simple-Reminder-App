	- Front-End (UI)  - A **front**-**end**  developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in an  application.  
	- Back-end (Android) - A **back**-**end**  developer is responsible for server-side web application logic and integration of the work front-**end**   developers do. **Back**-**end** developers usually write  services and APIs used by front-**end**  developers and mobile application developers.
	- Project Manager - **Project managers** play the lead **role** in planning, executing, monitoring, controlling and closing **projects**. They are accountable for the entire **project** scope, **project** team, resources, and the success or failure of the **project**.
	- Design & Documentation - Develop **design** documentations, technical specifications and other **project** related documentations as needed. Attend **project** meetings to discuss about any issues and new **design** ideas.
	- Unit Testing - The main objective of **unit testing** is to isolate written code to **test** and determine if it works as intended. **Unit testing** is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later **testing** stages.
