# Test Plan

**Author**: Alex Lee and Eldrid Gonsalves

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

We plan to have a few members of the team come up with different scenarios in which the application will be used.\
With these scenarios, we will then simulate how the application will run, keeping in mind the many different combinations and possibilities of inputs and outputs that can be produced.

### 1.2 Test Selection

The test cases will be selected based on the importance to the application.\
We will be using both black-box and white-box testing techniques to test the application's code and structure.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

The quality and goal of our test cases will be based on and aim to properly achieve statement coverage.\
This will be our primary focus, making sure that the application will run properly, given different situations.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs that come up during testing, as well as after the release of the application, will be brought to the attention to the part of the team that worked on the affected portion of the application.\
Depending on the severity and how widespread the bug's effect may be, other parts of the team may have to be informed as well, and a solution will need to be worked on.\
Enhancements to the application will be handled similarly, with the appropriate part(s) of the team coming together to make satisfactory changes.

### 1.5 Technology

We plan to use JUnit, as well as manual black-box testing techniques for our numerous test cases.
