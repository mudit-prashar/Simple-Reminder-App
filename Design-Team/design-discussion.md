## Summary
<details>
  Discussing the designs with each other helped us realize what was really needed in our group's final UML design. We were able to see many similarites in the way we implemented classes, class methods, and class relationships. Discussing the designs helped us to quickly point out new or unique features in our individual designs to assign a level of significance to them. This helps us prioritize what we need to focus on first, while still being able to consider other features to be added later.
